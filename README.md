# Forage-Virtual-Iternship-Project-5

This project from Forage was based on a fictional utility company called PowerCo. The power-liberalization of the energy market in Europe has led to significant customer churn, especially in the SME (Small & Medium Enterprise) segment. They have partnered with us to help diagnose the source of churning for SME customers.

The objective that PowerCo has set for the data analytics team is to derive insights that would help evaluate the current business performance and suggest metrics that would enable them to make the decision on why customers are churning.

The analytics team is tasked with:

- Performing some exploratory data analysis. Looking into the data types, data statistics, specific parameters, and variable distributions.
- What kind of exploratory analyses on the relevant fields can give more insights about the customer's churn behavior?
- Think of data sources and fields that could be used to explore the contribution of various factors to a customerâ€™s possible action.
- What the key factors are for a customer deciding to stay with or switch providers?
- Extraction of sample data sets using SQL.
- Analysis of sample data sets with visualizations.
- Cleaning the dataset in Excel.

Main Datasets Analyzed:
- Client_Data
- Price_Data
- Utility_Data (A view that was created by joining the client and price data table).
